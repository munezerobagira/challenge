# Technical test for Front-End Engineer

## Context:

- Imagine that you are appointed to lead a team of engineers to revamp a legacy application that is used worldwide.
- For the sake of this test lets say the application is called â€œHotels&Co"
- The tech team is composed of back-ends, front-ends, UI,UX designers, a product owner as well as a scrum master. The business team is also there to help with requirements as subject mater experts.

## Mission:

Your mission is to rebuild from scratch a front-end application for a legacy platform that serves millions of customers around the world.
We would like to use a modern stack for this rebuild.
This is what is required to deliver:

- **Strategy:** Please explain step by step using bullet points the strategy you would use to get the job done.
  - Your strategy needs to show what needs to happen from day 1 until go-live of the application.
  - This strategy must display your great understanding of engineering practices, you engage with business units (departments), the design team, you use proper terms as well as how you understand back-end requirements to design amazing source code solutions.
- Code source: The goal of this exercise is to showcase your ability to build react applications in a modern and streamlined way. For the purpose of this exercise we would like you to use the following libraries/frameworks:
  - Next JS
  - React-query
  - Tailwind CSS
  - React testing library
    Feel free to use any other libraries on top of the ones above.

## The challenge:

The users of Hotels&Co are in various locations around the globe some of which do not have very fast internet. Our goal is to ensure a great user experience for our users wherever they may be.
For our rebuild we would like to start with the home page for Hotels&Co for this page we are going to take some inspiration from Airbnb.com

The acceptance criteria are as follows:

- A user should be able to see a paginated list of all rooms listed on the site
  To achieve this you might want to mock a json rest api response by using a service like https://mockapi.io
  Tip: Infinite scroll pagination is a plus
- The page should perform well for low internet speeds as well as faster ones
  Tip: look closely at the Airbnb.com home page
- A user should be able to view details for a single item by selecting it from the list

The evaluation criteria are as follows:

- How the code is structured
- Code simplicity, readability, maintainability and how easy it is to test
- Reusability and UI components structure
- Creativity/Innovation
  **Take note:**
- The strategy is expected to be in the readme of the source code
- The source code needs to be pushed to git and accessible to recruiters until end of January
- Your code should be ready to be run without extra configuration
- In case you think there is another source code where you have done amazing stuff that you have built and that can draw a better picture of your coding skills, you are allowed to submit it in the place of the one mentioned in this exercise.
